from tkinter import *

# tkinter has three layout management methods pack , place , grid
# its difficult to provide a precise position for the buttons wwith pack
# place is used for precise positioning and we can give x and y values
# any widget is created but no positioning method is used then it wont be shown
# for more precision aand simple usage gri is used as it imagines entire window as a grid and we can specify 
# our rows and columns for each widget
#  simple way to work with grid is to specify your starting widget at 0,0

# You caan mix grid and pack in the same program

# we can add some paadding to our window by directly modyfying the widgets
window = Tk()
